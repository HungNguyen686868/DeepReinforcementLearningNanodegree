# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Bananas-Project

In this project, I trained an agent to navigate and collect bananas (yellow and blue) in a large, square world. If an agent collects a yellow banana, it will get a reward of +1. Otherwise, it will get a reward of -1 for collecting a blue banana. Therefore, the goal of an agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
